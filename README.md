# Terraform module: Virtual Machine (EC2, AutoScaling Group)

This module have the following features, they are all optional:

- X EC2 instances or one AutoScaling Group with X capacity.
- X extra volumes attached to each instances, encrypted by default, with optional KMS key (only for EC2).
- X extra network interfaces attached to each instances (only for EC2).
- A Key Pair shared with all instances.
- Elastic IPS for each instances and/or for specific extra network interfaces (only for EC2).

This module creates the same kind of instances.
They share the same features.
To create different instances, calls this module multiple times.

## Notes

To install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`.
It will automatically `validate`, `fmt` and update *README.md* for you.

The variable `root_block_device_delete_on_termination` set to false is not tested because it will create resources that will persist a terraform build. Therefore untill we find a more permanent solution for this we do NOT test this feature.

## Limitations

- AWS does not handle external volumes with AutoScaling Groups.
Because of this, if an AutoScaling Group with one or more EBS volume is destroy, the EBS volumes would be preserved, resulting in phantom volumes (unseen by Terraform).
That’s why every extra volumes within an AutoScaling group will always be destroyed by using this module (delete_on_termination = true).
- Same kind of resources will share the same tags. It’s not possible to assign tag to a specific instance, as specific volume or a specific network interface.
